# Releasing EffectCraft

Every push to the `release` branch runs [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml).
It builds signed installers for macOS, Windows, Linux and the web, then creates or updates a
**draft** GitHub Release named `EffectCraft v<version>`. Nobody sees a draft until a maintainer
publishes it.

User-facing names say **EffectCraft**. Files, binaries and ids stay lowercase
(`effectcraft-<version>-<platform>-<arch>.<ext>`).

## Cutting a release

1. **Bump the version** on `main`. It lives in one place, `[workspace.package] version` in the
   root `Cargo.toml`:

   ```sh
   cargo xtask version                 # prints the current version, e.g. 0.3.1
   cargo xtask version set 0.4.0       # or 0.4.0-rc.1; updates Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock
   ```

   Open a PR titled `Release: EffectCraft v0.4.0` with that change (`Cargo.toml` and our crates
   in `Cargo.lock` only) and merge it.
2. **Check the gate.** Run `cargo xtask ci` on `main` (it runs clippy and the tests in release
   mode, as CI does), and check that `main`'s CI is green on every platform.
3. **Push `main` to `release`** (a fast-forward): `git push origin main:release`. The `release`
   branch is protected; only maintainers can push to it. The workflow starts by itself.
4. **Wait for the draft.** When every job is green (macOS notarization is the slow part), the
   Releases page has a draft `EffectCraft v0.4.0`, tagged `v0.4.0` on the pushed commit, with
   every artifact and `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Its notes are generated from the merged PRs.
5. **Check it.** Download an installer or two, check them against `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and run
   `effectcraft --version` / `effectcraft-cli --version`. Read the job summaries: a `::warning::`
   means a signing secret was missing and that artifact is unsigned.
6. **Publish** the draft in the GitHub UI (or `gh release edit v0.4.0 --draft=false --latest`),
   with a short *Highlights* section above the generated notes. Publishing creates the `v0.4.0`
   tag. Versions with a pre-release suffix (`-rc.1`) are marked as pre-releases.

Pushing to `release` again before you publish rebuilds the same draft and replaces its assets.
Once the draft is published, the workflow refuses to touch that version again
(`Release v<version> is already published. Bump the version (cargo xtask version set) before
pushing to release.`), so bump it first.

**Test runs:** *Actions › Release › Run workflow* runs the whole pipeline by hand. The optional
`version` input (such as `0.4.0-rc.1`) overrides `Cargo.toml` for that run only: the jobs apply it
with `cargo xtask version set` before building, so the binaries report it too. The run still
needs the `release` environment, which only the `release` branch can use, so pick that branch in
the dialog.

## What gets built

| Platform | Artifacts | Built on |
|---|---|---|
| macOS 11+ (universal: Apple silicon and Intel) | `effectcraft-<v>-macos-universal.dmg`, `effectcraft-cli-<v>-macos-universal.zip` | `macos-15` |
| Windows 10+ x64 | `effectcraft-<v>-windows-x64.msi`, `effectcraft-<v>-windows-x64-portable.zip` | `windows-latest` |
| Windows 10+ x64 (office) | `effectcraft-Setup-x64.exe`, `effectcraft-Portable-x64.zip` | tag `v*` (see below) |
| Windows 10+ x86 (32-bit) | `effectcraft-<v>-windows-x86.msi`, `effectcraft-<v>-windows-x86-portable.zip` | `windows-latest` |
| Windows 11 ARM64 | `effectcraft-<v>-windows-arm64.msi`, `effectcraft-<v>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` | cross-compiled on `windows-latest` |
| Linux x86_64 | `effectcraft-<v>-linux-x86_64.{AppImage,deb,rpm,tar.gz}` | `ubuntu-22.04` |
| Linux aarch64 | `effectcraft-<v>-linux-aarch64.{AppImage,deb,rpm,tar.gz}` | `ubuntu-22.04-arm` |
| Web | `effectcraft-web-<v>.zip` (a static site; see [web.md](web.md)) | `ubuntu-latest` |

The ARM64 MSI is installed and run on ARM64 hardware by
[`windows-arm64.yml`](../.github/workflows/windows-arm64.yml).

### Windows office install (per-user Setup.exe + portable zip)

Pushing a version tag (`v0.5.1`, `v0.5.1-rc.1`) runs
[`.github/workflows/windows-office-install.yml`](../.github/workflows/windows-office-install.yml)
on `windows-latest`. It builds the MSVC binaries, compiles an Inno Setup installer, zips a
portable copy, writes `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and attaches all three to the GitHub Release for that tag.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `effectcraft-Setup-x64.exe` | Per-user installer. No administrator rights. Destination `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Craft\effectcraft`. Start menu + desktop shortcuts, the pink unicorn icon, an uninstaller. Optional task adds `effectcraft-cli` to the current user's PATH. |
| `effectcraft-Portable-x64.zip` | Extract anywhere and double-click `effectcraft.exe`. `portable.txt` next to the exe keeps settings in that folder instead of `%APPDATA%\EffectCraft`. |
| `SHA256SUMS.txt` | SHA-256 of the two files. |

The installer does **not** include `portable.txt`, so an installed copy uses AppData. The WiX MSI
on the `release` branch is still the per-machine Program Files package.

Build them locally on Windows with Inno Setup 6 installed:

```powershell
pwsh packaging/windows/package-office.ps1
```

On Linux, `packaging/windows/cross-gnu.sh` produces the portable zip (mingw). Then
`packaging/windows/package-office.sh` restages `effectcraft-Portable-x64.zip` and compiles
`effectcraft-Setup-x64.exe` with Inno Setup under Wine when ISCC is available, or with
NSIS (`makensis`, `effectcraft.nsi`) when it is not. The tag workflow on `windows-latest`
always uses Inno Setup.

Every binary reports its version: `effectcraft --version`, `effectcraft-cli --version` and
*Help › About EffectCraft*.

### Linux: the glibc baseline

Linux binaries link against the glibc of the machine that builds them and need at least that
version wherever they run. The release builds on the oldest GitHub-hosted image,
**Ubuntu 22.04 (glibc 2.35)**, so the packages run on Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+ and
RHEL 10. Building on a newer image would silently raise that floor. `packaging/linux/package.sh`
builds the AppImage, `.deb`, `.rpm` and tarball; the workflow then runs the AppImage's
`--version` as a smoke test.

## Signing

Every job runs in the `release` environment, which only the `release` branch can use and which
holds the signing secrets. Every secret is optional: a missing one produces an unsigned artifact
and a warning in the job summary, never a failed build.

| Platform | Secrets |
|---|---|
| macOS (Developer ID signing and notarization) | `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` |
| Windows (a certificate, or Azure Trusted Signing) | `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE`, `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, or `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`, `AZURE_CERT_PROFILE` |
